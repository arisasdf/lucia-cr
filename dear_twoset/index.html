      <p><span class="intro-sentence">When I saw Twoset's</span> story on Instagram recruiting a developer, I immediately knew it was an opportunity I had been waiting for without realising it, so I am quite pleased and excited to be applying for the position. I am very grateful for the work Twoset Violin do for the young musician community and the general public. It would be a delight and an honour to form part of a team which delivers such fantastic content and amazing merch.</p>
      <p><span class="intro-sentence">I have solid experience</span> in various aspects of full-stack web development: from Ruby on Rails and Java backends, to a number of frontend frameworks such as Ember, Backbone, React and Vue. I’m the most motivated developing front-facing applications that deliver a smooth user experience as well as reliable functionality.</p>
      <p><span class="intro-sentence">My goal as a developer</span> is to always provide robust, elegant and efficient solutions, maintaining high standards and good practices such as automated testing and disciplined use of source control tools. I am not afraid to lead, teach and conciliate, using assertive communication as a primary tool to keep any team well-oiled and achieving their goals.</p>
      <p><span class="intro-sentence">I am currently based in Costa Rica</span> (where I was born and raised) and I’m used to working from home and with remote teams. I am currently working exclusively from home and I’m comfortable continuing to do so indefinitely, but I also have flexibility and am willing to move abroad.</p>
      <p><span class="intro-sentence">Other than software</span>, I am passionate about music and singing (I’m an opera Ling Ling Wannabe), having participated in a number of choral and operatic productions in Costa Rica, as a choir singer, soloist, and production assistant. I try to travel as much as my schedule allows and enjoy tabletop roleplaying and video games.</p>
      <p>PS: I'm sorry it took me so long to apply, I had to put some things in order first.</p>
